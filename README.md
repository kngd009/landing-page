# landing-page

For this project Iâ€™ll be creating an entire web page from a design Odin provided for me. 

Update: I  have finished the project and what can I say is that it's really impressive.. I have learned so much things and hope I'll learn much more in the next lessons.

Hopefully you'll enjoy this website, I didn't add any aditional files/photos, but it's brautiful the way it is! Thank you!
